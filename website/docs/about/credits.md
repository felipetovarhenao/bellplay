Iâ€™m [Felipe Tovar-Henao](https://felipe-tovar-henao.com), and I develop and maintain **bellplay~**. The project began as part of my residency as the Charles H. Turner Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music](https://ccm.uc.edu/), where it originated in the context of my research. Development has continued beyond the residency and remains ongoing.

The source code can be found at [here](https://github.com/felipetovarhenao/bellplay).

**Special thanks to**:

- **Andrea Agostini** and **Daniele Ghisi**, authors of the [bach ecosystem](https://www.bachproject.net), which forms the technical foundation for symbolic processing in **bellplay~**.
- **Benjamin D. Smith**, developer of [ml.star](https://www.benjamindaysmith.com/), used for some machine learning features.
