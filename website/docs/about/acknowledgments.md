# Acknowledgments

**bellplay~** relies on several key tools and frameworks:

- The `bach` `dada` and `ears` libraries for symbolic and audio processing.
- `ml.star` for machine learning and automation tasks.
- The [Max](https://cycling74.com/downloads) environment, which serves as the runtime host.

This project would not exist without the years of work behind these tools.

Thanks also to the early users and students who provided feedback, tested features, and helped shape the usability and direction of **bellplay~**.
