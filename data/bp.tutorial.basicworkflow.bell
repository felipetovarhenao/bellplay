# Basic Workflow

The general workflow of a bell script in **bellplay~** is the following:

1. **Generation**: buffers are created using synthesis or sampling techniques, and optionally analyzed/processed.
2. **Transcription**: buffers are queued for rendering, each symbolically represented as a note in staff notation.
3. **Rendering**: All transcribed buffers are compiled and rendered into a single audio buffer. This buffer can then be used for subsequent iterations of this workflow to refine the final output as needed. 

Below is an introductory example of a _bell_ script in **bellplay~**, which generates a short sinusoidal wave at 440 Hz:

)#
## first, let's generate buffer, in this case a sinusoidal oscillator.
$osc = cycle();
## then we transcribe the buffer for rendering
$osc.transcribe();
## finally, we render transcribed buffer
render()

When you load a `.bell` file in _bellplay~_, the code is automatically evaluated everytime you save it. As such, it's worth memorizing and using the keyboard shortcut to save a file — `⌘+S` on Mac, and `Ctrl+S` on Windows.
