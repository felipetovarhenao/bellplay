# Markers

Sometimes it's useful to include markers in the transcription.
For instance, to label things, or simply to debug something in our code.

## generate first 16 harmonics with fundamental frequency of 110 Hz
$harmonics = (1...16) * 110;
## envelope as breakpoint function 
$envelope = [0 0 0] [1 .125 0.25] [10 0 -.25];
## iterate through each harmonic frequency
for $fq $i in $harmonics do (
    ## make every onset 300 ms apart
    $onset = ($i - 1) * 300;
    ## add marker to identify position and number of each harmonic (optional)
    addmarker(@onset $onset @names $i);
    ## generate 1.5 sceonds of a sinusoidal oscillator as  buffer and transcribe
    cycle($fq @duration 1500).transcribe(
        @onset $onset
        ## apply previosly created envelope
        @gain $envelope
        ## random panning position
        @pan rand() 
    ) 
);
## render transcribed buffers
