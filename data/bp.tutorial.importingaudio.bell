# Importing Audio

In **bellplay~** we can also generate buffers by importing our own audio files into our scripts.
For this, we use the 'importaudio' function, which takes a file path as a symbol and returns a buffer.

Since **bellplay~** comes with a few built-in audio files, they will be used throughout the tutorials for demonstration purposes.
In the tutorial below, "poem.wav" is one such file, which is why it does not require a relative or absolute path syntax.
However, you should always experiment with your own sounds, by providing a valid path (absolute, or relative to your bell script location) to a file in your computer.

)#
## path to built-in audio file
$path = 'poem.wav';
## uncomment the lineðŸ‘‡ below to use a file path of your choosing
## $path = "/path/to/my/file.wav";
## use file path to import audio file as a buffer
$buff = importaudio($path);
## transcribe buffer and render
$buff.transcribe();
render()
