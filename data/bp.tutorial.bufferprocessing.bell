# Buffer Processing

One of the core features of **bellplay~** is the ability to dynamically and flexibly apply chains of DSP algorithms to our buffers. 
This tutorial shows a very basic example of this by applying reverse delay to an audio file.

)#
## path to built-in audio file
$path = 'drums.wav';
## uncomment the line belowðŸ‘‡ to use a file path of your choosing
## $path = "/path/to/my/file.wav";
## use file path to import audio file as a buffer
$buff = importaudio($path);
## apply processing to buffer. Notice that we need re-assign the variableÂ â€” operations in bell are not destructive/do not happen in-place.
$buff = $buff.process(
    ## reverse buffer
    reverse() 
    ## apply reverb
    freeverb(@tail 500) 
    ## reverse again
    reverse() 
);
## transcribe and render
$buff.transcribe(@gain .125);
render(@play 1)
