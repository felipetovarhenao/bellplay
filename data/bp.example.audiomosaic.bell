    AUDIO MOSAICKING
    --------------------------------
    An example of basic audio mosaicking in bellplay~ â€” a target audio 
    is reconstructed using a corpus of short audio segments. It outlines the 
    process of setting up parameters for analysis, selecting audio fragments based 
    on feature similarity, and assembling the final output. 
)#
## Define the audio features to extract (MFCC and loudness)
$features = mfcc() larm();
## Set threshold, alpha value, and delay parameters for onset detection analysis
$thresh = 0.01;
$alpha = 0.05;
$delay = 5;
## Build a corpus using the specified audio files and feature descriptors
buildcorpus(
    ## Audio sources for corpus
    @files 'badinerie.wav' 'trumpet.wav' 'singing.wav' 
    ## Extracted features for similarity search
    @descriptors $features
    ## Weighting factor for analysis
    @alpha $alpha
    ## Silence detection threshold
    @silencethreshold $thresh
    ## Delay before onset detection
    @delay $delay
);
## Query the generated corpus to retrieve stored buffer references
$bufs = query();
## Extract feature keys from the features list
$featurekeys = for $f in $features collect $f.getkey('output'):-1;
$buf2features = (
    $buf -^ $featurekeys -> [for $k in $featurekeys collect $buf.getkey($k) ] 
);
$data = for $b in $bufs collect $buf2features($b);
## Build a search tree for efficient retrieval based on extracted features
$tree = createtree($data);
## Import a target audio file for analysis
$target = importaudio('drums.wav');
## Perform onset detection on the target audio
$analysis = onsets(
    ## Weighting factor for analysis
    @alpha $alpha
    ## Delay before onset detection
    @delay $delay
    ## Silence detection threshold
    @silencethreshold $thresh
);
## Apply the analysis to the target audio buffer
$target = $target.analyze($analysis);
## Retrieve detected onset positions from the analysis
$markers = $target.getkey('onsets');
## Compute segment durations based on onset markers
$markerdurs = x2dx($markers $target.getkey('duration'));
## Loop through detected onset markers and corresponding durations
for $marker in $markers, $dur in $markerdurs do (
    ## Define a segment from the target buffer using detected offset and duration
    $segment = $target.setkey('duration', $dur).setkey('offset', $marker);
    ## Analyze the segment with the predefined feature descriptors
    $segment = $segment.analyze($features);
    ## Search the corpus for the best-matching segment
    $point = $buf2features($segment);
    $id = querytree($tree, $point);
    $match = $bufs:$id;
    ## Transcribe the matched segment with onset and gain envelope settings
    $match.transcribe(
        ## Align match onset with detected marker
        @onset $marker
        ## Place match in center of stereo field
        @pan 0
        ## Apply gain envelope
        @gain [0 1 0] [1 0 -0.25] 
    ) 
);
## Transcribe the original target audio on the right stereo channel
$target.transcribe(@pan 1);
## Render the final output with normalization applied
render(
    ## Normalize audio to -3 dB
    @play 1 @process normalize(-3)
