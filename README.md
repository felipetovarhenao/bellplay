# **grainscript~** _offline audio granulation_

### Description

**grainscript~** is a simple application for offline, corpus-based audio granulation. In **grainscript~**, the general workflow is comprised of two main stages: _corpus creation_, and _audio generation_ via `.bell` scripts. 

First, users create a database (i.e., a _corpus_) of grains from a folder of audio samples, where each grain is analyzed in terms of psycho-acoustically relevant features, such as pitch, loudness, pitch class, spectral centroid, and more. Then, users can manipulate these grains via `.bell` scripts, and generate sequences that can be rendered and exported as either .wav, .mid, or .llll (native) files. 

These scripts are written in the bach evaluation language for lllls, or `bell` for short. The typical structure of a script is as follows:

1) *Load* a corpus.
2) *Retrieve* grains from the corpus using #sqlite3 queries.
3) *Manipulate* grains and add them to the rendering queue.
4) *Render* all aded grains into an audio buffer.
5) *Export* the rendered sequence as audio, midi, or native .llll format.

Hereâ€™s a very basic example of a `bell` script:

```py
## step 1: load corpus
setcorpus("/path/to/corpus.llll");

## step 2: retrieve all grains
$grains = query("SELECT * FROM grains");

## step 3: add all grains to rendering sequence, with random onset between 0 and 2000 ms
for $grain in $grains do transcribe($grain, @onset rand(2000));

## step 4: trigger audio rendering
render();

## step 5: export to audio
export("./out.wav")
```
